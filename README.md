### 8th place!
I tried to simulate the challenge, so i gave myself just 4 hours of time and if i had partecipated i would have arrived 8th.  
I'm quite happy of this result, but as a side effect the code is ugly. It should be refactored in orderto be more comprehensible.
In particular the coice of using tuples makes the code hard to read.  
A more elegant solution would be to use [named lists](https://pypi.org/project/namedlist/).
